  <p id="Hi">Hello, my name is Matthew Benjamin Dias, but I go by Matt. I'm 17 year old, I go to Fowler High School, and I hope to graduate from there. I like to do many things, but staying inside and being a hermit is my favorite thing to do. I took Geekwise because I have always loved working with technology. I cannot live without technology. I wish to pursue a career that involves working with technology. I'm also a big Batman fanboy.</p>

<h3>Here are some of the projects I worked on in Geekwise</h3>
<div id="spoopy">
  <a href="spoopy/index.html"><img src="img/spoopy.png" alt="Image of a Halloween website"></a>
  <p>This is the most recent project that we worked on. I had lots of fun on working with site and it's the one I'm most proud of because I learned a lot from working on it. Click on the image to be directed to my copy of the site.</p>

<div id="cars">
  <a href="oct6/index.html"><img src="img/cars.png" alt="Image of a cars website"></a>
  <p>Note: This project was unfinished due to difficulty for me since I was just a beginner. This project gave me the most trouble out of the all the first few projects. Click on the image to see what I have so far.</p>

<div id="bierrock">
  <a href="oct19-berrockshop/index.html"><img src="img/bierrock.png" alt="Image of the berrock shop website"></a>
  <p>This is another project that we worked on. We remade the Berrock Shop website and made it mobile friendly. This is the finshed product after we all worked on it together. Click the image to be directed my copy of the website.</p>
