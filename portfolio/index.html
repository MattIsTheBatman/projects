  <p id="Hi">Hello, my name is Matthew Benjamin Dias, but I go by Matt. I'm 17 year old, I go to Fowler High School, and I hope to graduate from there. I like to do many things, but staying inside and being a hermit is my favorite thing to do. I took Geekwise because I have always loved working with technology. I cannot live without technology. I wish to pursue a career that involves working with technology. I'm also a big Batman fanboy.</p>

<h3>Here are some of the projects I worked on in Geekwise</h3>

  <p>Note: This project was unfinished due to difficulty for me since I was just a beginner. This project gave me the most trouble out of the 3.</p>
