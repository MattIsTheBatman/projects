  <p id="Hi">Hello, my name is Matthew Benjamin Dias, but I go by Matt. I was born to a middle class family, I dream to achieve big things in life. I'm currently a senior at Fowler High School, from which I hope to graduate. I took the Geekwise class because I have always been a tech geek. I cannot live without technology. I wish to pursue a career that involves working with technology. They say if you choose a job you love, you'll never work a day in your life. </p>
